    <h1>Fruits</h1>
    <h2>Apples</h2>
    <h3>Crisp and Tart</h3>
    <p>Apples are good in many different forms. They are great straight from an apple tree, but also taste good baked with cinnamon and sugar, turned into a juice or cider, or even in desserts. They are known for their association with the fall, and I love making an apple crisp latte in this season.</p>
