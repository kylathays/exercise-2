    <h3>Vanilla, Chocolate, Quantity & Quality</h3>
    <p>Cupcakes typically come in batches, 4-12 is a common. There used to be a bakery by my house back in my hometown called Carl's Cakes, and they had incredible inhouse cupcakes. My two favorites of theirs was the carrot cupcake and the red velvet cupcake. They had a perfect ratio between cake and frosting.</p>
